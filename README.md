Hospital Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline hospital operations efficiently. It is developed using Java, JSP, Servlets, and JDBC, ensuring secure and seamless interaction with the database. The system follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design principles, making it modular, scalable, and easy to maintain.

The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. The system enables hospital staff to manage patient records, doctor appointments, and medical reports effectively. It facilitates seamless communication between doctors, nurses, and administrative staff.

Patients can register, book appointments, and access their medical history through the system. Doctors can update diagnoses, prescribe medications, and manage their schedules efficiently. The admin panel provides role-based access control for managing users, staff, and hospital data securely.

The system supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for patient records, doctor details, appointments, and billing. JDBC is used for database connectivity, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval. JSP pages handle dynamic content, while Servlets manage backend processing and request handling.

Security features such as authentication and authorization ensure that sensitive medical information is protected. The system improves hospital workflow, reduces paperwork, and enhances overall efficiency. It is designed to be easily expandable, allowing integration with additional hospital services in the future.
